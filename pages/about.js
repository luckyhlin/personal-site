                <div className={styles.aboutParagraph}>
                    I have learned programming since primary school, whereas I focused mostly on algorithms instead of applications (e.g. web programming).
                    Therefore, due in part to my laziness, handcrafting a site was always an unaccomplished goal for me.
                </div>
                <div className={styles.aboutParagraph}>
                    Things have changed since I started to manage knowledge on the amazing software, Notion, where I found it a great place to write memos, especially
                    technical stuff. After one or two years, I realized it was time to produce more cohesive memos to better organize and memorize important topics.
                    During my gap year, Notion published exciting news that their API would be out of beta. I knew it was time to handcraft a site, where Notion
                    can be my content management system (CMS).

                <div className={styles.aboutParagraph}>
                    Therefore, this site is powered by Next.js as an SSG frontend framework, Notion official API,
                    Notion as CMS, Vercel as site host, giscus as comment system, Namecheap as domain registration, GitHub as repo host, and the open source community. 🤟
